# Vision

PaniniFS aims at a semantic filesystem where meaning comes first.

- Focus on the linguistics+computing axis (the “what”) before implementation details (the “how”).
- “Docs as code”, bilingual FR/EN, synchronized page by page.
- Prefer external references for standard concepts (do not reinvent wheels).

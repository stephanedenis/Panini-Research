# Linguistic Foundations

- Pāṇini and formal grammar as inspiration for concise, operational representations of meaning.
- Bridge between primitive linguistic units and engineering operations (clear, testable contracts).
- Align with existing practices (formal grammars, typing, operational semantics).

Guidelines: keep minimal definitions, reference external sources, and state their mapping to PaniniFS.

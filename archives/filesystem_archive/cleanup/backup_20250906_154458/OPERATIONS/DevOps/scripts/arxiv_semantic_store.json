However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development. In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly. While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.",

      "abstract": "Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

Raising the level of abstraction, however, rarely comes free - a performance penalty is possible. How good, then, are current machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads?   We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future directions for improvement.",

Data is critical and penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article, we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning models, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step of machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future directions.",

This paper presents Deep Logic Models, which are deep graphical models integrating deep learning and logic reasoning both for learning and inference. Deep Logic Models create an end-to-end differentiable architecture, where deep learners are embedded into a network implementing a continuous relaxation of the logic knowledge.

Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a \"sweet spot\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.",

This paper presents a neural filter to enhance the accuracy of long-term state predictions of neural network-based models of dynamic systems. Motivated by the extended Kalman filter, the neural filter combines the neural network state predictions with the measurements from the physical system to improve the estimated state's accuracy. The neural filter's improvements in prediction accuracy are demonstrated through applications to four nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments show that the neural filter significantly improves prediction accuracy and bounds the state estimate covariance, outperforming the neural network predictions. Furthermore, it is also shown that the accuracy of a poorly trained neural network model can be improved to the same level as that of an adequately trained neural network model, potentially decreasing the training cost and required data to train a neural network.",

The Cortex Neural Network is an upper architecture of neural networks which motivated from cerebral cortex in the brain to handle different tasks in the same learning system.

To study aIQ and neural efficiency, two simple neural networks were trained on MNIST: a fully connected network (LeNet-300-100) and a convolutional neural network (LeNet-5). The LeNet-5 network with the highest aIQ was 2.32% less accurate but contained 30,912 times fewer parameters than the highest accuracy network. Both batch normalization and dropout layers were found to increase neural efficiency. Finally, high aIQ networks are shown to be memorization and overtraining resistant, capable of learning proper digit classification with an accuracy of 92.51% even when 75% of the class labels are randomized. These results demonstrate the utility of aIQ and neural efficiency as metrics for balancing network performance and size.",

Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in control systems (known as neural feedback loops), most notably by using a neural network as a controller. However, one of the big challenges of this approach is that neural networks have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. This means that, unless they are designed properly, they are not an ideal candidate for controllers due to issues with robustness and uncertainty, which are pivotal aspects of control systems. There has been initial work on robustness to both analyse and design dynamical systems with neural network controllers. However, one prominent issue with these methods is that they use existing neural network architectures tailored for traditional machine learning tasks. These structures may not be appropriate for neural network controllers and it is important to consider alternative architectures. This paper considers rational neural networks and presents novel rational activation functions, which can be used effectively in robustness problems for neural feedback loops. Rational activation functions are replaced by a general rational neural network structure, which is convex in the neural network's parameters. A method is proposed to recover a stabilising controller from a Sum of Squares feasibility test. This approach is then applied to a refined rational neural network which is more compatible with Sum of Squares programming. Numerical examples show that this method can successfully recover stabilising rational neural network controllers for neural feedback loops with non-linear plants with noise and parametric uncertainty.",

It was shown that such systems behave like convex systems under various restrictedsettings, such as for two-level neural networks, and when learning is only restricted locally inthe so-called neural tangent kernel space around specialized initializations. However, there areno theoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks encountered inpractice. This paper solves this fundamental problem by investigating such overparameterizeddeep neural networks when fully trained. We generalize a new technique called neural feature repopulation, originally introduced in (Fang et al., 2019a) for two-level neural networks, to analyze deep neural networks. It is shown that under suitable representations, overparameterized deep neural networks are inherently convex, and when optimized, the system can learn effective features suitable for the underlying learning task under mild conditions. This new analysis is consistent with empirical observations that deep neural networks are capable of learning efficient feature representations. Therefore, the highly unexpected result of this paper can satisfactorily explain the practical success of deep neural networks. Empirical studies confirm that predictions of our theory are consistent with results observed in practice.",

The intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels. Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks. Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as real-valued networks.",

      "abstract": "As the demand for querying databases in all areas of life continues to grow, researchers have devoted significant attention to the natural language interface for databases (NLIDB). This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recently proposed NLIDBs. We begin with a brief introduction to natural language processing techniques, executable database languages and the intermediate representation between natural language and executable language, and then provide an overview of the translation process from natural language to executable database language. The translation process is divided into three stages: (i) natural language preprocessing, (ii) natural language understanding, and (iii) natural language translation. Traditional and data-driven methods are utilized in the preprocessing stage. Traditional approaches rely on predefined rules and grammars, and involve techniques such as regular expressions, dependency parsing and named entity recognition. Data-driven approaches depend on large-scale data and machine learning models, using techniques including word embedding and pattern linking. Natural language understanding methods are classified into three categories: (i) rule-based, (ii) machine learning-based, and (iii) hybrid. We then describe a general construction process for executable languages over relational and spatio-temporal databases. Subsequently, common benchmarks and evaluation metrics for transforming natural language into executable language are presented, and methods for generating new benchmarks are explored. Finally, we summarize the classification, development, and enhancement of NLIDB systems, and discuss deep language understanding and database interaction techniques related to NLIDB, including (i) using LLM for Text2SQL tasks, (ii) generating natural language interpretations from SQL, and (iii) transforming speech queries into SQL.",

      "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) aims at investigating the interactions between agents and humans, processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data. Large-scale language models play an important role in current natural language processing. However, the challenges of explainability and complexity come along with the developments of language models. One way is to introduce logical relations and rules into natural language processing models, such as making use of Automated Planning. Automated planning (AI planning) focuses on building symbolic domain models and synthesizing plans to transit initial states to goals based on domain models. Recently, there have been plenty of works related to these two fields, which have the abilities to generate explicit knowledge, e.g., preconditions and effects of action models, and learn from tacit knowledge, e.g., neural models, respectively. Integrating AI planning and natural language processing effectively improves the communication between human and intelligent agents. This paper outlines the commons and relations between AI planning and natural language processing, argues that each of them can effectively impact on the other one by five areas: (1) planning-based text understanding, (2) planning-based natural language processing, (3) planning-based explainability, (4) text-based human-robot interaction, and (5) applications. We also explore some potential future issues between AI planning and natural language processing. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first work that addresses the deep connections between AI planning and Natural language processing.",

The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.",

Besides, text classification task, as a basic task of natural language processing, how to combine it to multiple languages in the Dravidian languages, is still a major difficulty in Dravidian Natural Language Processing. Hence, to address these problems, we proposed a multilingual text classification framework for the Dravidian languages. On the one hand, the framework used the LaBSE pre-trained model as the base model. Aiming at the problem of text information bias in multi-task learning, we propose to use the MLM strategy to select language-specific words, and used adversarial training to perturb them. On the other hand, in view of the problem that the model cannot well recognize and utilize the correlation among languages, we further proposed a language-specific representation module to enrich semantic information for the model. The experimental results demonstrated that the framework we proposed has a significant performance in multilingual text classification tasks with each strategy achieving certain improvements.",

This work contributes original diagrammatic representations of the Japanese language based on prior work that accomplished on the English language based on category theory. The germane differences between the English and Japanese languages are emphasized to help address English language bias in the current body of research. Additionally, topological principles of these diagrams and many potential avenues for further research are proposed. Why is this endeavor important? Hundreds of languages have developed over the course of millennia coinciding with the evolution of human interaction across time and geographic location. These languages are foundational to human survival, experience, flourishing, and living the good life. They are also, however, the strongest barrier between people groups. Over the last several decades, advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have made it easier to bridge the gap between individuals who do not share a common language or culture. Tools like Google Translate and DeepL make it easier than ever before to share our experiences with people globally. Nevertheless, these tools are still inadequate as they fail to convey our ideas across the language barrier fluently, leaving people feeling anxious and embarrassed. This is particularly true of languages born out of substantially different cultures, such as English and Japanese. Quantum computers offer the best chance to achieve translation fluency in that they are better suited to simulating the natural world and natural phenomenon such as natural speech.

Then, we review the limitations of current SLP models and identify the open challenges to extend NLP to signed languages.

Specifications in controlled natural language are automatically translated into Prolog clauses, hence become formal and executable. The translation uses a definite clause grammar (DCG) enhanced by feature structures. Inter-text references of the specification, e.g. anaphora, are resolved with the help of discourse representation theory (DRT). The generated Prolog clauses are added to a knowledge base.

The use of large language models as effective tools in various natural language processing tasks typically requires extensive textual data and robust hardware resources. Consequently, the scarcity of Persian textual data and the unavailability of powerful hardware resources have hindered the development of large language models for Persian. This paper introduces the first large Persian language model, named PersianLLaMA, trained on a collection of Persian texts and datasets. This foundational model comes in two versions, with 7 and 13 billion parameters, trained on formal and colloquial Persian texts using two different approaches. PersianLLaMA has been evaluated for natural language generation tasks based on the latest evaluation methods, namely using larger language models, and for natural language understanding tasks based on automated machine metrics. The results indicate that PersianLLaMA significantly outperforms its competitors in both understanding and generating Persian text. PersianLLaMA marks an important step in the development of Persian natural language processing and can be a valuable resource for the Persian-speaking community. This large language model can be used for various natural language processing tasks, especially text generation like chatbots, question-answering, machine translation, and text summarization",

In this paper, we propose a natural language interface, NLI-GIBIR, to a graph-based bibliographic information retrieval system. In designing NLI-GIBIR, we developed a novel framework that can be applicable to graph-based bibliographic information retrieval systems. Our framework integrates algorithms/heuristics for interpreting and analyzing natural language bibliographic queries. NLI-GIBIR allows users to search for a variety of bibliographic data through natural language. A series of text- and linguistic-based techniques are used to analyze and answer natural language queries, including tokenization, named entity recognition, and syntactic analysis. We find that our framework can effectively represents and addresses complex bibliographic information needs. Thus, the contributions of this paper are as follows: First, to our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose a natural language interface to graph-based bibliographic information retrieval. Second, we propose a novel customized natural language processing framework that integrates a few original algorithms/heuristics for interpreting and analyzing natural language bibliographic queries. Third, we show that the proposed framework and natural language interface provide a practical solution in building real-world natural language interface-based bibliographic information retrieval systems. Our experimental results show that the presented system can correctly answer 39 out of 40 example natural language queries with varying lengths and complexities.",

However, that is not to say that the traditional computer vision techniques which had been undergoing progressive development in years prior to the rise of DL have become obsolete. This paper will analyse the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. The aim of this paper is to promote a discussion on whether knowledge of classical computer vision techniques should be maintained. The paper will also explore how the two sides of computer vision can be combined. Several recent hybrid methodologies are reviewed which have demonstrated the ability to improve computer vision performance and to tackle problems not suited to Deep Learning. For example, combining traditional computer vision techniques with Deep Learning has been popular in emerging domains such as Panoramic Vision and 3D vision for which Deep Learning models have not yet been fully optimised",

However, the conventional assessment metrics suitable for usual object detection are deficient in the maritime setting. Thus, a large body of related work in computer vision appears inapplicable to the maritime setting at the first sight. We discuss the problem of defining assessment metrics suitable for maritime computer vision. We consider new bottom edge proximity metrics as assessment metrics for maritime computer vision. These metrics indicate that existing computer vision approaches are indeed promising for maritime computer vision and can play a foundational role in the emerging field of maritime computer vision.",

These computer vision algorithms are being practised in medical image analysis and are transfiguring the perception and interpretation of Imaging data. Among these algorithms, Vision Transformers are evolved as one of the most contemporary and dominant architectures that are being used in the field of computer vision. These are immensely utilized by a plenty of researchers to perform new as well as former experiments. Here, in this article we investigate the intersection of Vision Transformers and Medical images and proffered an overview of various ViTs based frameworks that are being used by different researchers in order to decipher the obstacles in Medical Computer Vision. We surveyed the application of Vision transformers in different areas of medical computer vision such as image-based disease classification, anatomical structure segmentation, registration, region-based lesion Detection, captioning, report generation, reconstruction using multiple medical imaging modalities that greatly assist in medical diagnosis and hence treatment process. Along with this, we also demystify several imaging modalities used in Medical Computer Vision. Moreover, to get more insight and deeper understanding, self-attention mechanism of transformers is also explained briefly. Conclusively, we also put some light on available data sets, adopted methodology, their performance measures, challenges and their solutions in form of discussion.

They have made remarkable progress in computer vision tasks by aligning text modality with vision inputs. There are also endeavors to incorporate multi-vision sensors beyond RGB, including thermal, depth, and medical X-ray images. However, we observe that current LVLMs view images taken from multi-vision sensors as if they were in the same RGB domain without considering the physical characteristics of multi-vision sensors. They fail to convey the fundamental multi-vision sensor information from the dataset and the corresponding contextual knowledge properly. Consequently, alignment between the information from the actual physical environment and the text is not achieved correctly, making it difficult to answer complex sensor-related questions that consider the physical environment. In this paper, we aim to establish a multi-vision Sensor Perception And Reasoning benchmarK called SPARK that can reduce the fundamental multi-vision sensor information gap between images and multi-vision sensors. We generated 6,248 vision-language test samples to investigate multi-vision sensory perception and multi-vision sensory reasoning on physical sensor knowledge proficiency across different formats, covering different types of sensor-related questions. We utilized these samples to assess ten leading LVLMs. The results showed that most models displayed deficiencies in multi-vision sensory reasoning to varying extents.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is an essential paradigm for solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Despite many remarkable achievements in recent decades, applying reinforcement learning methods in the real world remains challenging. One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge. Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer. This has led to the emergence of causal reinforcement learning, a subfield of reinforcement learning that seeks to enhance existing algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal reinforcement learning. We first introduce the basic concepts of causality and reinforcement learning, and then explain how causality can address core challenges in non-causal reinforcement learning. We categorize and systematically review existing causal reinforcement learning approaches based on their target problems and methodologies. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions in this emerging field.",

Plenty of methods have been developed for sample efficient deep reinforcement learning, such as environment modeling, experience transfer, and distributed modifications, amongst which, distributed deep reinforcement learning has shown its potential in various applications, such as human-computer gaming, and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we conclude the state of this exciting field, by comparing the classical distributed deep reinforcement learning methods, and studying important components to achieve efficient distributed learning, covering single player single agent distributed deep reinforcement learning to the most complex multiple players multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we review recently released toolboxes that help to realize distributed deep reinforcement learning without many modifications of their non-distributed versions.

      "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms learn to solve a task, but are unable to improve their ability to learn. Meta-learning methods learn about machine learning algorithms and improve them so that they learn more quickly. However, existing meta-learning methods are either hand-crafted to improve one specific component of an algorithm or only work with differentiable algorithms. We develop a unifying meta-learning framework, called Reinforcement Teaching, to improve the learning process of \\emph{any} algorithm. Under Reinforcement Teaching, a teaching policy is learned, through reinforcement, to improve a student's learning algorithm. To learn an effective teaching policy, we introduce the parametric-behavior embedder that learns a representation of the student's learnable parameters from its input/output behavior. We further use learning progress to shape the teacher's reward, allowing it to more quickly maximize the student's performance. To demonstrate the generality of Reinforcement Teaching, we conduct experiments in which a teacher learns to significantly improve both reinforcement and supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement Teaching outperforms previous work using heuristic reward functions and state representations, as well as other parameter representations.",

      "abstract": "Consider learning a policy from example expert behavior, without interaction with the expert or access to reinforcement signal. One approach is to recover the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning, then extract a policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks, from which we derive a model-free imitation learning algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free methods in imitating complex behaviors in large, high-dimensional environments.",

      "abstract": "While deep reinforcement learning has shown important empirical success, it tends to learn relatively slow due to slow propagation of rewards information and slow update of parametric neural networks. Non-parametric episodic memory, on the other hand, provides a faster learning alternative that does not require representation learning and uses maximum episodic return as state-action values for action selection. Episodic memory and reinforcement learning both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Notably, humans can leverage multiple memory systems concurrently during learning and benefit from all of them. In this work, we propose a method called Two-Memory reinforcement learning agent (2M) that combines episodic memory and reinforcement learning to distill both of their strengths. The 2M agent exploits the speed of the episodic memory part and the optimality and the generalization capacity of the reinforcement learning part to complement each other. Our experiments demonstrate that the 2M agent is more data efficient and outperforms both pure episodic memory and pure reinforcement learning, as well as a state-of-the-art memory-augmented RL agent. Moreover, the proposed approach provides a general framework that can be used to combine any episodic memory agent with other off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms and imitation learning are three principal methods to deal with continuous control tasks. Reinforcement learning is sample efficient, yet sensitive to hyper-parameters setting and needs efficient exploration; Evolutionary algorithms are stable, but with low sample efficiency; Imitation learning is both sample efficient and stable, however it requires the guidance of expert data. In this paper, we propose Recruitment-imitation Mechanism (RIM) for evolutionary reinforcement learning, a scalable framework that combines advantages of the three methods mentioned above. The core of this framework is a dual-actors and single critic reinforcement learning agent. This agent can recruit high-fitness actors from the population of evolutionary algorithms, which instructs itself to learn from experience replay buffer. At the same time, low-fitness actors in the evolutionary population can imitate behavior patterns of the reinforcement learning agent and improve their adaptability. Reinforcement and imitation learners in this framework can be replaced with any off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learner or data-driven imitation learner. We evaluate RIM on a series of benchmarks for continuous control tasks in Mujoco. The experimental results show that RIM outperforms prior evolutionary or reinforcement learning methods. The performance of RIM's components is significantly better than components of previous evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, and the recruitment using soft update enables reinforcement learning agent to learn faster than that using hard update.",

      "abstract": "Meta-learning algorithms use past experience to learn to quickly solve new tasks. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms acquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by utilizing experience from prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning generalizes best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an instantiation of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions consist of formulating the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and describing how task proposals based on mutual information can be used to train optimal meta-learners. Our experimental results indicate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design and these procedures exceed the performance of learning from scratch.",

In this paper we propose that the answer may lie in the geometrization of deep networks. Geometrization is a bridge to connect physics, geometry, deep network and quantum computation and this may result in a new scheme to reveal the rule of the physical world. By comparing the geometry of image matching and deep networks, we show that geometrization of deep networks can be used to understand existing deep learning systems and it ma...",

Chang\nCategories: cs.LG, stat.ML\nAbstract: Probabilistic deep learning is deep learning that accounts for uncertainty, both model uncertainty and data uncertainty. It is based on the use of probabilistic models and deep neural networks. We distinguish two approaches to probabilistic deep learning: probabilistic neural networks and deep probabilistic models. The former employs deep neural networks that utilize probabilistic layers which can represent and process uncertainty; the latter uses probabilistic models that incorporate deep neura...",

Large-scale language models play an important role in current natural language processing. However, the challenges of explainability and complexity come along with the developments of language models. One way is to introduce logical relations and rules into natural language processing models, such as making use of Automated Planning....",

We show that despite their many successes at performing linguistic tasks, Large Neural Language Models are ill-suited as comprehensive models of natural language. The wider implication is that, in spite of the often overbearing optimism about AI, modern neural models do not represent a revolution in our understanding of cognition....",

One approach is to recover the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning, then extract a policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement lea...",
